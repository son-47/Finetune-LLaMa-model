        "response": "A. A thermostat is an embedded device without a traditional user interface. A light bulb\nwould have no user interface, even if it has network capabilities. A set-top cable box\nwould have a custom interface and not a general-purpose one. The only device here that\nis a general-purpose computing platform with a traditional user interface—screen and\nkeyboard—is the smartphone, so it isn’t part of the IoT."

        "question": "What are the three steps in the TCP handshake as described by the flags set?\nA. SYN, SYN/URG, RST\nB. RST, SYN, ACK\nC. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK\nD. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK/URG",
        "response": "C. The three-way handshake is used to establish a connection. The first message has the\nSYN flag set and includes the sequence number. The response from the server has the ACK\nflag set for the SYN message that was sent from the client. The acknowledgment number\nis set. Additionally, in the same message, the server sends its own SYN flag and sequence\nnumber. The client then responds with an ACK message. So, the sequence is SYN,\nSYN/ACK, and ACK."

        "question": "Which of these protocols would be used to communicate with an IoT device?\nA. ICMP\nB. SMTP\nC. Telnet\nD. HTTP",
        "response": "D. While ICMP may be used as part of passing control messages in case of errors in\nthe network, it wouldn’t be used between the IoT device and a server. SMTP is an email\nprotocol that also wouldn’t be used. Telnet is a cleartext protocol used to gain command-\nline access to a system. HTTP would commonly be used to pass messages between a\ncontrolling server and an IoT device."

        "question": "Which network topology are you most likely to run across in a large enterprise network?\nA. Ring topology\nB. Bus topology\nC. Full mesh\nD. Star-bus hybrid",
        "response": "D. Ring networks were once common but are much less so now. You may find a ring\nnetwork in a service provider network today. A bus topology is best suited for a smaller\nnetwork. Full mesh isn’t a very common topology, in part because of the expense and\ncomplexity it brings. A star-bus hybrid would be common. An enterprise would use\nmultiple switches that were all connected to one another over a bus, while all the endpoints\nwould connect to the switch in a star topology."

        "response": "A. Manual pages provide documentation for commands and programs. IEEE is the\nInstitute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which does manage some protocols\nbut isn’t documentation itself. Standards on the Internet are actually uncommon\nand only happen after a very long period of time. The best place to find definitive\ndocumentation about protocols seen on the Internet is in the Request for Comments (RFC)\ndocuments."

        "question": "The PDU for TCP is called a .\nA. Packet\nB. Datagram\nC. Frame\nD. Segment",
        "response": "D. At the Network layer, the PDU is a packet. The Network layer is IP. At the Data Link\nlayer, the PDU is a frame. Commonly, the protocol would be Ethernet there. UDP uses\ndatagram as the PDU. TCP uses segment for the PDU."

        "question": "Which header field is used to reassemble fragmented IP packets?\nA. Source address\nB. IP identification\nC. Don’t fragment bit\nD. Acknowledgment field",
        "response": "B. The source address is used as the address to send back to on the response, making it the\ndestination address. The don’t fragment bit is used to tell network devices not to fragment\nthe packet. The acknowledgment field is part of the TCP header and not the IP header. The\nIP identification field is used to identify fragments of the same packet, as they would all\nhave the same IP identification number."

    {
        "question": "Which protocol is necessary to enable the functionality of traceroute?\nA. HTTP\nB. SNMP\nC. ICMP\nD. IP",
        "response": "C. The traceroute program uses UDP messages with the time to live field starting at 1.\nThis is incremented for each hop in the network until the destination is reached. Each\ndevice would send an ICMP time exceeded in transit message back to indicate the TTL had\nexpired. The source of that message indicates the address of the network hop. On Windows\nsystems, tracert uses ICMP echo request messages, also incrementing the time to live value.\nBecause of these two factors, traceroute requires ICMP to work."

        "question": "To remove malware from the network before it gets to the endpoint, you would use which\nof the following?\nA. Packet filter\nB. Application layer gateway\nC. Unified threat management appliance\nD. Stateful firewall",
        "response": "C. Packet filters are used to make block/allow decisions based on header data like source\nand destination address and port. Stateful firewalls add in the ability to factor in the\nstate of the connection—new, related, established. An Application layer gateway knows\nabout Application layer protocols. A unified threat management appliance adds additional\ncapabilities on top of firewall functions, including antivirus."

        "response": "D. Confidentiality is about making sure secrets are kept secret. Integrity makes sure that\ndata isn’t altered accidentally or by an unauthorized agent. Non-repudiation makes sure\nsomeone can’t say a message didn’t originate with them if it came from their identity.\nAvailability means making sure data is where it needs to be when it should be there. This\nincludes services as well."

        "question": "Which of the following is one factor of a defense in depth approach to network design?\nA. Switches\nB. Using Linux on the desktop\nC. Optical cable connections\nD. Access control lists on routers",
        "response": "D. Switches and optical cable connections can certainly be part of a network design, but in\nand of themselves they don’t add any security features. You may use Linux on the desktop,\nbut without more of a strategy for patch and vulnerability management, Linux is no better\nthan other operating systems. Access control lists on routers can add an additional layer\nof security, especially when combined with other elements like firewalls and intrusion\ndetection systems."

    {
        "question": "How would you ensure that confidentiality is implemented in an organization?\nA. Watchdog processes\nB. Encryption\nC. Cryptographic hashes\nD. Web servers",
        "response": "B. Confidentiality is keeping secret information secret, which means unauthorized users\ncan’t access it. Encryption is a good way to keep unauthorized users from data because in\norder to get to the data, they need to have the key. Watchdog processes are used to ensure\nthat programs remain running. Cryptographic hashes are used to verify the integrity of\ndata. Web servers are used to serve up information."

        "question": "An intrusion detection system can perform which of the following functions?\nA. Block traffic\nB. Filter traffic based on headers\nC. Generate alerts on traffic\nD. Log system messages",
        "response": "C. Firewalls are used to block traffic into a network, though an intrusion prevention\nsystem will also block traffic. A packet filtering firewall uses header information, such as\nsource and destination address and port, to determine whether to allow traffic into the\nnetwork. Syslog and the Windows event subsystem can be used to log system messages.\nIntrusion detection systems can be used to generate alerts on traffic."

        "question": "Which of these would be an example of a loss of integrity?\nA. User making changes to a file and saving it\nB. Bad blocks flagged on disk\nC. Credit cards passed in cleartext\nD. Memory failures causing disk drivers to run incorrectly",
        "response": "D. If a user makes a change to a file and saves it, that’s an intentional act and the data\nis what the user expects and wants. If the disk drive has flagged bad blocks on the disk,\nthe drive won’t write any data out to those blocks, so there will be no loss of integrity.\nCredit cards passed in cleartext would be a violation of confidentiality. Memory failures,\nthough, could cause a loss of data integrity, even in the case of writing data to the drive. The\ncorrupted data in memory could be written to disk. Also, memory failures may cause issues\nwith the disk driver, which may also cause data corruption."

        "response": "A. Security information event managers are used to aggregate event data, such as log\ninformation. Once the data has been aggregated, it can be searched and correlated. Even\nthough it’s called an event manager, it isn’t used to manage security projects, nor is it\nused to escalate security events. Other tools can be used to gather and store open-source\nintelligence."

        "question": "Why is it important to store system logs remotely?\nA. Local systems can’t handle it.\nB. Bandwidth is faster than disks.\nC. Attackers might delete local logs.\nD. It will defend against attacks.",
        "response": "C. Commonly, system logs are stored on the system that generated the log message.\nCertainly local systems can handle the logs they have generated. Log messages don’t\ntypically consume a lot of space at an individual message level, so bandwidth isn’t a\nproblem. Transmitting over a network is generally not faster than moving data within\nlocal disks. System logs can be used in identifying attacks, but the logs won’t defend against\nattacks. However, if an attacker does compromise a system, the attacker may delete the\nlocal logs because they could get access to them."

        "question": "What would be necessary for a TCP conversation to be considered ESTABLISHED by a\nstateful firewall?\nA. Final acknowledgment message\nB. Three-way handshake complete\nC. Sequence numbers aligned\nD. SYN message received",
        "response": "B. In TCP, a three-way handshake is used to synchronize sequence numbers and establish a\nconnection. While the sequence numbers are shared, they wouldn’t be called aligned, which\nmight suggest that each end was using the same sequence number. A SYN message is part\nof the three-way handshake, but it is not sufficient to establish a connection. Option A,\n“Final acknowledgment message,” is ambiguous. It could refer to the acknowledgment to a\nFIN message, closing the connection."

        "response": "A. Standards and practices should be derived from a security policy, which is the high-\nlevel guidance on the role of security within an organization. Security does not generally\nincrease the bottom line of a company. Policies are not for providing specific directions,\nwhich would be the role of procedures."

        "question": "What important event can be exposed by enabling auditing?\nA. System shutdown\nB. Service startup\nC. Package installation\nD. User login",
        "response": "D. While system shutdown, service startup, and package installation may be events that\nare logged, they are generally logged by normal system logging. Auditing functions are\ndifferent between Windows and Linux/Unix, but audit systems for both will generate logs\nwhen a user logs into a system."

        "question": "What can an intrusion prevention system do that an intrusion detection system can’t?\nA. Generate alerts\nB. Block or reject network traffic\nC. Complete the three-way handshake to bogus messages\nD. Log packets",
        "response": "B. While an intrusion prevention system can generate alerts, so can an intrusion detection\nsystem. Both systems may also be able to log packets, as needed. A bogus message likely\nwouldn’t result in a completed three-way handshake, and the handshake shouldn’t be\ncompleted anyway. An intrusion prevention system can, however, block or reject network\ntraffic, while an intrusion detection system can’t."

        "question": "Which of these is an example of an application layer gateway?\nA. Web application firewall\nB. Runtime application self-protection\nC. Java applet\nD. Intrusion prevention system",
        "response": "A. Runtime application self-protection is a plug-in used on an application server to prevent\nbad messages from impacting the application. A Java applet is an implementation of a Java\nprogram. An intrusion prevention system is used to detect and block potential intrusions.\nA web application firewall, however, makes decisions based on Application layer traffic and\nwill either allow or block that traffic. This makes it an Application layer gateway."

        "response": "C. A packet filter would use layer 2/3/4 headers to make decisions. An HTTP REQUEST\nmessage is at the Application layer (layer 7). Ethernet type isn’t used to make decisions in a\npacket filter. SNMP OID is also an Application layer message. A packet filter would, though, use\nsource or destination ports, potentially, to make decisions about allowing or blocking a packet."

        "response": "D. A buffer overflow attack is used to execute attacker-supplied code by altering the return\naddress in the stack. A man in the middle attack can be used to intercept and potentially\nalter a conversation between two systems. A heap spraying attack sends a lot of data into\nthe heap to overwrite what’s there. A watering hole attack does not compromise integrity\nsince its purpose is to introduce malware to a system. The malware might eventually\ncompromise integrity, but the watering hole attack itself does not."

        "question": "What type of attack is a compromise of availability?\nA. Watering hole\nB. DoS\nC. Phishing\nD. Buffer overflow",
        "response": "B. A watering hole attack looks to compromise a system that visits a website. A phishing\nattack looks to gather information from victims, potentially by compromising the victim’s\nsystem. A buffer overflow attack tries to introduce code provided by the attacker. A denial\nof service attack, however, has the intention of making a service unavailable for users."

The destination port is open on the target host.\nC. The source port in the RST message is closed.\nD. The target expects the PSH flag to be set.",
        "response": "C. A TCP scan sends messages to the target, expecting to get a response. With a SYN or\nfull connect scan, the target will respond with a SYN/ACK message from an open port.\nWith a closed port, the target will respond with a RST."

A SYN scan uses the PSH flag with the SYN flag.\nD. The SYN scan doesn’t complete the three-way handshake.",
        "response": "D. A SYN scan sends the first SYN message and then responds with a RST message after\nreceiving the SYN/ACK from the target. A full connect scan completes the three-way\nhandshake before sending the RST message. Since the full connect scan follows the correct\norder of the three-way handshake, it doesn’t send an ACK first. There is also no PSH flag\nsent with the SYN flag, since there is no data to push up the stack yet."

        "question": "What is one reason a UDP scan may take longer than a TCP scan of the same host?\nA. UDP will retransmit more.\nB. UDP has more ports to scan.\nC. UDP is a slower protocol.\nD. UDP requires more messages to set up.",
        "response": "A. There is no defined response to a message to a UDP port. It is left entirely up to the\napplication. Since a lack of response can mean the message never reached its recipient,\nthe scanning system has to retransmit to closed ports. UDP is generally quicker than TCP\nbecause of a lack of overhead, it requires no messages to set up, and it has the same number\nof ports as TCP."

        "question": "Why does an ACK scan not indicate clearly that ports are open?\nA. The scanner has to guess.\nB. ACK is not a supported flag.\nC. The target system ignores the message.\nD. ACK scans cause a lot of retransmits.",
        "response": "C. When a system receives an ACK message, meaning a TCP segment with the ACK flag\nenabled (bit position storing a 1), it assumes there is an open connection and there is data\nthat is being acknowledged. When there is no open connection, there is nothing to respond\nwith. The system, not having anything else to do with the ACK, discards it. The scanner\nwon’t receive a response if the port is open. However, the scanner can’t be certain that the\nmessage hasn’t just been discarded by a firewall. As a result, it indicates that the port is\neither open or filtered. Either would result in no response. The scanner isn’t guessing; it is\nproviding two alternatives but can’t be certain which it is. ACK is a supported flag in the\nright circumstances and ACK scans do not cause retransmits, since no response means one\nof two things."

        "response": "A. Evasion is an important concept. You may spend a lot of time working on evading\ndetection or getting blocked. Since an ACK without an open connection is aberrant, the\nfirewall or IDS may ignore it, avoiding detection. As a result, you may be able to get ACK\nmessages through. ACK scans are not better supported. In fact, there is really no support\nfrom the network stack for an ACK scan. The code is no more robust in nmap for an ACK\nscan than other scans, or at least there is no evidence of that being the case. ACK scans are\nnot needed for scripting support."

        "response": "D. When nmap performs an operating system scan, it is looking for fingerprints of the\nnetwork stack in the operating system kernel. Some of the information that nmap will look\nat is in the IP ID field to see what numbers are used. Similarly, it will look at the initial\nsequence number in TCP messages to see what numbers are used there. The application\nversion isn’t relevant to an operating system scan, and there are no operating system\nheaders that would be associated with network traffic. Operating system headers could be\nconsidered to be part of the source code for the operating system, but nmap wouldn’t be able\nto see those. Port 0 is considered an invalid port, so the response to a connection from that\nport is irrelevant."

        "response": "C. The program masscan is a port scanner, like nmap. However, masscan was developed\nto scan the entire Internet as quickly as possible. As a result, if speed is a consideration,\nand especially if you are scanning large address blocks, masscan is probably better suited\nfor that task. Both nmap and masscan have access to the same address space, and masscan\nuses the same command-line parameters, for the most part, as nmap, so they are similarly\neasy to use. nmap has also been around for considerably longer, since the 1990s, than\nmasscan has."

The\ncommand hping -S -p 25 10.5.16.2 is used to have hping send SYN messages to port\n25, the default SMTP port, at 10.5.16.2. It’s possible that someone mistyped ping, but\nthose parameters aren’t used by ping programs, and since they are coherent for the action\nabove, it makes more sense that they were trying to use hping.

        "response": "C. Attackers often install extra files and run extra processes on systems. These could easily\nbe detected by manual investigation or, certainly, by automated detection tools. The way\naround that is to install a rootkit, which may include kernel-mode drivers or replacement\nsystem utilities that would hide the existence of these files and processes. Alternate data\nstreams may be used to hide files but not processes. Registry keys could also hide files but\nnot processes."

        "response": "B. Pivoting is the process of using a compromised system to move onto other systems and\nnetworks within the target environment. Pivoting does not get you higher-level permissions\nor persistent access. You may ultimately get to a database server by pivoting, but that’s not\nwhat pivoting does or is specifically used for. It would be a nice side effect of pivoting."

        "response": "B. The program rtgen is a program that is part of the rcrack suite. rcrack is used to crack\npasswords with rainbow tables. It is used to generate the rainbow tables that rcrack will\nuse to crack passwords. Rainbow tables are not wordlists but mappings of plaintext\npasswords to hashes, which makes it much easier to get passwords from hashes."

        "response": "C. Malformed packets could potentially cause a failure or trigger a vulnerability on the\nserver side. Large ICMP packets aren’t likely to do anything and certainly wouldn’t exploit\na client-side vulnerability. A brute-force password attack isn’t exploiting a vulnerability,\neven if it is an attack technique. Sending a crafted URL could potentially exploit a client-\nside vulnerability in a web browser."

        "question": "What is one outcome from process injection?\nA. Hidden process\nB. Rootkit\nC. Alternate data streams\nD. Steganography",
        "response": "A. Steganography is the process of hiding data inside of other data, such as media files like\nMP3s, WAVs, or video files. An alternate data stream is a secondary data stream attached\nto a filename in the NT file system. A rootkit can be used to hide processes. It may use\nprocess injection but wouldn’t be the outcome from process injection. When you inject into\na process, you are putting executable operations you have created into the space of another\nexecutable. The end result could be an execution thread running your code without any\nnew process name indicating it was running."

        "response": "D. John the Ripper is used for cracking passwords, while nmap is used for port scanning.\nThey could be part of the overall process of system compromise, but neither could be\nused to compromise a system, in spite of what it suggests in The Matrix. searchsploit is a\nprogram used to search a local exploit-db repository. Metasploit is an exploit framework\nthat could be used to compromise a system. Once the system is compromised, Metasploit\ncould then be used for post-exploitation actions using modules that come with it."

        "response": "B. Of all of the options presented, only the web browser exists on the client side. By\ndefinition, the web server is on the server. A web application firewall is placed with the\nserver to protect the server from Application layer attacks. Web pages are hosted on a web\nserver. They are not a target for client-side exploits, though they would be used to carry out\nthose attacks."

        "response": "C. A rootkit is a piece of malicious software that is used to accomplish several tasks. This\nmay include hiding processes and files through the use of kernel-mode drivers or replaced\nsystem utilities. A rootkit may also provide a backdoor for attackers to maintain long-term\naccess to the system after the initial compromise. None of the other answers are things that\na rootkit does."

        "question": "What could you use to obtain password hashes from a compromised system?\nA. John the Ripper\nB. Mimikatz\nC. Rainbow tables\nD. Process dumping",
        "response": "B. John the Ripper and Rainbow tables are tools for cracking passwords, not gathering\nor obtaining password hashes. Process dumping could possibly yield passwords associated\nwith a certain process/application. However, you may not get password hashes, depending\non how the passwords are maintained in memory. Process dumping is taking the memory\nspace of a process and writing it out to disk for analysis. Mimikatz is a utility and\nMetasploit module that could be used to extract passwords from a compromised system."

        "response": "C. Both worms and viruses could be written to use polymorphic code, which means they\ncould modify what they look like as they propagate. A worm, though, could self-propagate.\nIt’s the one distinction between worms and viruses. Viruses require some intervention on\nthe part of the user to propagate and execute."

        "response": "C. Static analysis is looking at the properties of the executable file and evaluating the\nassembly language code without running the program. This will limit your exposure to\ninfection, because if you do it right you aren’t running the program, which would infect\nyou. Dynamic analysis is trustworthy, and malware can’t deploy if you don’t run it.\nDynamic analysis is commonly done in virtual machines."

        "response": "D. VirusTotal takes dozens of antivirus engines and runs samples through them to identify\nwhat malware they might be. VirusTotal is a website, which means it can’t check your\nsystem for viruses and also can’t do any endpoint protection. While VirusTotal can identify\nthe name given to a malware sample by different antivirus solutions, to find the research\nassociated with that malware, you would need to check with the antivirus vendor."

        "response": "D. PE files have multiple sections that you may find in an executable. Two that are very\ncommon, though, are .text and .data. The .text section includes all the executable code. The\n.data section includes all the predefined and initialized variables. The other sections listed\nin other answers aren’t sections of a PE file."

        "question": "What is the purpose of a packer for malware?\nA. To obscure the actual program\nB. To ensure that the program is all binary\nC. To compile the program into a tight space\nD. To remove null characters",
        "response": "A. All programs that have been compiled are in binary. Even scripting languages are in\nbinary by the time they hit the processor. Packers will make a program smaller, which was\ninitially of some value when bandwidth wasn’t as ubiquitous, but a packer doesn’t do any\ncompilation. A packer does not remove null characters. A packer can, however, obscure the\nactual program code because the only executable function is one designed to extract and\ndecompress the real malware."

        "question": "What is the primary purpose of polymorphic code for malware programs?\nA. Efficiency of execution\nB. Propagation of the malware\nC. Antivirus evasion\nD. Faster compilation",
        "response": "C. Polymorphic means many bodies, which means it has multiple looks. When a program\nhas multiple looks, it can cause antivirus programs to misidentify it. Polymorphic code\nrewrites the program when it is copied or moved from one system or location to another.\nIt isn’t more efficient and doesn’t help with propagation, though it could be part of the\npropagation process. It also doesn’t speed compilation."

        "response": "B. Python interpreters may be considered slower to execute than a compiled program,\nbut the difference is negligible and speed of execution generally isn’t much of a concern\nwhen it comes to malware. Python is not a hard language to learn, and there are a lot of\ncommunity-developed libraries. One challenge, though, is that you may need a Python\ninterpreter unless you go through the step of getting a Python compiler and compiling your\nscript. Windows systems wouldn’t commonly have a Python interpreter installed."

        "question": "What would you use Cuckoo Sandbox for?\nA. Static analysis of malware\nB. Malware development\nC. Dynamic analysis of malware\nD. Manual analysis of malware",
        "response": "C. Cuckoo Sandbox is a set of programs and infrastructure used to run malware and\nidentify changes to the system that result. This means it is used for dynamic analysis of\nmalware, not for static analysis. Because it’s automated, it’s not manual. Also, it’s used for\nanalysis, not development."

        "response": "B. You need a tool that can perform disassembly if you are doing static analysis. Dynamic\nanalysis can make use of disassembled executables, but the tool would need to also be able\nto execute the code. IDA is the only tool there that does both disassembly and execution.\nCutter only does disassembly. PE Explorer does neither, and MalAlyzer doesn’t exist."

        "response": "A. An executable contains a set of binary values that the CPU will interpret as operation\ncodes (opcodes) when the program is run. These binary values won’t generally mean much\nto people when they are bare. As a result, disassemblers are used to convert opcodes to\nmnemonics, which are short/abbreviated words that can let someone know what the opcode\ndoes."

        "response": "B. An encoder is used to alter the look of an executable file. This alteration is done in order\nto prevent the antivirus program from recognizing the executable as malware. It doesn’t\ncompile the malware and doesn’t evade user detection. A packer would be used to compress\nmalware."

A poison pill was created.\nB. A malicious program was generated.\nC. Existing malware was encoded.\nD. Metasploit was started.",
        "response": "B. The program msfvenom is used to convert a payload module from Metasploit into an\nexecutable program. The malware could potentially be used as part of a poison pill, which\nis a type of defensive tactic, but it’s hard to determine that just from the command line.\nWhile the malware is encoded as part of this process, it is not an existing piece of malware.\nThis is not a way to start Metasploit, though msfvenom does make use of the Metasploit\nframework."

        "response": "A. This is a bit of a trick question. Ransomware may be a virus, which means it is a\nsubset of the category virus. Ransomware may ask to be paid in Bitcoins, but it doesn’t\ninclude Bitcoins. Ransomware has been generated all over the world and viruses run on all\noperating systems."

A\nTrojan can’t evade antivirus if there is a signature that matches the executable. It doesn’t\nact as malware infrastructure, and while it may be polymorphic, that wouldn’t be why\nsomeone used a Trojan."

        "response": "B. When you are trying to dynamically analyze malware, a debugger is useful because it\nallows you to run the malware and also control its execution. OllyDbg is the only debugger\nin that list. Cutter does disassembly but does not allow you to run the malware and control\nits execution.\n19. Client. The malware would act as a client.

        "response": "C. Baiting is leaving a lure out in order to gather targets. You could use USB sticks or CDs\naround as bait if they had software on them that would run and “infect” the target system\nin a way that would give you control over them. While all of the other options are related to\nsocial engineering, none of them is called baiting."

        "response": "B. Social proof is in use when it appears to be okay to engage in a behavior because you see\nothers engaging in it. When people see a line of others waiting to grab USB sticks, in spite\nof knowing they shouldn’t trust USB sticks, they may be inclined to lower their defenses.\nThere is no reciprocity or authority here. There may eventually be scarcity, but that’s not\nwhat would drive people to stand in line to acquire a potentially dangerous item."

        "response": "D. Biometrics and badge access are forms of physical access control. Phone verification\ncould possibly be used as a way of verifying identity, but it won’t protect against tailgating.\nA man trap, however, will protect against tailgating because a man trap allows only one\nperson in at a time."

        "question": "Why would you use wireless social engineering?\nA. To send phishing messages\nB. To gather credentials\nC. To get email addresses\nD. To make phone calls",
        "response": "B. Especially in enterprises, there is generally some authentication that happens. This\ncould be in the form of a pre-shared key or a username/password combination. Either way,\nwhen you are using social engineering of wireless networks, you are probably attempting\nto gather credentials to gain access to sites. It’s unlikely you’d use this vector for sending\nphishing messages or getting email addresses, and it wouldn’t be used to make phone calls."

        "question": "Why would you use automated tools for social engineering attacks?\nA. Better control over outcomes\nB. Reduce complexity\nC. Implement social proof\nD. Demonstrate authority",
        "response": "B. It’s debatable whether you get better control over outcomes executing your attacks\nmanually. You would not be implementing social proof or demonstrating authority using an\nautomated attack any more than if you did it manually. You would be reducing complexity,\nthough, since doing it manually means you would be setting up and controlling multiple\nmoving pieces. This gets to be complex, and the attack would fail if you didn’t get it just\nright."

        "response": "C. If you sent an email posing as a former co-worker, you could be implementing a couple\nof different social engineering principles. Because you have a story and a means to collect\ninformation fraudulently, you are using pretexting. The other attacks are also social\nengineering, but they are not pretexting."

        "response": "B. While some people do epoxy USB ports to prevent USB sticks from being inserted,\nit’s not a good approach and wouldn’t necessarily keep a baiting attack from working if\nthe bait is a CD-ROM. Browsing the Internet is common and no longer doing that won’t\nprotect you against baiting. Registry cloning isn’t really a thing in this context. Disabling\nautorun would keep any malicious software from running automatically from external\ndevices."

        "response": "D. A false acceptance rate measures how often a biometric system allows unauthorized\nusers access to a facility or area. A false failure (or reject) rate is inconvenient, and some\norganizations may consider that to be an issue, especially if it’s very high. However, a\nhigh false accept rate is probably more concerning because you are allowing people who\nare really unauthorized to have access. The other two are not statistics that are measured;\nthough they correlate to the others, they are not called false positive rate or false negative\nrate."

        "response": "D. A proximity card could enable tailgating, but it’s not the only thing—a key could enable\ntailgating as well. Technically, it’s not the card that allows tailgating anyway. It’s the way\nthe doors are configured and implemented. Phishing is unrelated, and technically, credential\ntheft is as well. Proximity cards, particularly if they use RFID tags, are susceptible to\ncloning."

        "question": "What would the result of a high false failure rate be?\nA. People having to call security\nB. Unauthorized people being allowed in\nC. Forcing the use of a man trap\nD. Reduction in the use of biometrics",
        "response": "A. A false acceptance rate would be allowing unauthorized people in. If you are an\nauthorized person but your biometric scanner isn’t working reliably and rejects you, you\nmay need to call security or someone else to let you into the building. Neither of the other\ntwo would be a result of a high false failure rate. They may be solutions to other problems,\nbut not a high false failure rate."

        "response": "A. Pretexting can work over email just as well as via a phone call. It may be more common\nfor people to have email than a phone, especially a company-owned landline. Phishing\nattacks are very successful, which is why they are so commonly used. With a phone call,\nthough, you could go into more detail and address questions or concerns as they arise.

You may end up with a Meterpreter interface to a remote system, but it wouldn’t be\nused to generate the attacks. wifiphisher is only used for Wi-Fi–based attacks and Social\nAutomator doesn’t exist. The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SE Toolkit) could be used to\nautomate email attacks as well as wireless attacks."

        "response": "B. Promiscuous mode is used on network interfaces to collect frames that are not destined\nfor the network interface. This is insufficient on a wireless network because the radio\nheaders are not captured. To capture radio headers, monitor mode needs to be enabled\nin addition to the promiscuous mode that will always be set to get all frames and all\ninformation from the frame. Only monitor mode gives the radio headers."

        "response": "C. Sniffing can be used to collect information that may be needed to launch wireless attacks.\nA deauthentication attack can be used to force a station to generate traffic. An evil twin\nattack uses a rogue access point to pretend to be a legitimate network. In order to decrypt\nnetwork traffic, you would need the key. One way to get the key is to reuse information from\nnetwork traffic that generated a known key. This is a key reinstallation attack."

        "response": "C. Bluetooth doesn’t use ports. While profiles are important, you get the profile capabilities\nduring the pairing process. Just performing a scan won’t get you a list of supported profiles.\nWhile you should be able to identify vendors as part of the process of running a Bluetooth\nscan, it’s not the purpose of the scan. The purpose is to identify endpoints and their\nassociated addresses so you can run other attacks on them."

        "response": "B. The purpose of a deauthentication attack is to force stations to reauthenticate. This allows\nthe attacker to collect information from the authentication and handshake. This information\ncould be used later to potentially derive the key, as in WEP transmissions. A deauthentication\nattack doesn’t disable stations.

        "question": "What part of the encryption process was weak in WEP?\nA. Keying\nB. Diffie-Hellman\nC. Initialization vector\nD. Seeding vector",
        "response": "C. The initialization vector is a random value that seeds the key used for encryption and\ndecryption. In WEP, the algorithm specified for the initialization vector yielded non-\nrandom, predictable values. While the initialization vector is part of keying, it’s not the\nkeying itself that was weak. Seeding vector is not a real thing, and Diffie-Hellman is a\nprocess used to derive and exchange keys securely. It’s not part of WEP."

        "response": "B. The four-stage handshake is used to authenticate stations against wireless networks.\nAs part of the handshake, encryption keys are generated. Keys are derived on both sides of\nthe transaction rather than being exchanged directly. This is handled during the four-way\nhandshake. Keys are not passed. Messages can’t be encrypted until the four-way handshake\nis complete and the keys are generated. There is no such thing as initialization seeding."

        "response": "D. Ad hoc and infrastructure are types of wireless networks. Only infrastructure uses\naccess points, but infrastructure is not a type of access point. WPA is an encryption\nprotocol. A rogue access point, meaning one that isn’t legitimate, is used in an evil twin\nattack by pretending to be a legitimate access point."

        "question": "How does an evil twin attack work?\nA. Phishing users for credentials\nB. Spoofing an SSID\nC. Changing an SSID\nD. Injecting four-way handshakes",
        "response": "B. An evil twin attack uses an access point masquerading as the point of connection for\nstations trying to connect to a legitimate wireless network. Stations reach out to make\nconnections to this access point masquerading as another access point. While you may\nphish for credentials as part of an evil twin attack, credential phishing is not how evil twin\nattacks work. SSIDs don’t get changed as part of an evil twin attack, meaning no SSID that\nexists will become another SSID. Injecting four-way handshakes won’t do much, since four-\nway assumes both ends are communicating, so the injection of a full communication stream\nwill get ignored."

        "response": "C. The Apple App Store and the Google Play Store are controlled by Apple and Google.\nIt’s not impossible to get malware onto mobile devices through them, but it’s very difficult\nbecause apps get run through a vetting process. While some Android devices will support\nexternal storage, it’s not an effective way to get malware onto a smartphone or other mobile\ndevice. Jailbreaking can lead to malware being installed, but it’s not the means to get\nmalware onto a mobile device. Third-party app stores can be a good means to get malware\nonto mobile devices because some third-party app stores don’t vet apps that are submitted."

        "response": "B. While DNS is also used for amplification attacks, Smurf attacks are a result of someone\nsending ICMP echo requests to the broadcast address of a network. The echo responses\nwould be sent to the address in the source of the request, which would be spoofed. If\nenough systems respond, the volume of responses can overwhelm the target system."

        "response": "C. An SQL injection attack makes use of SQL queries, which can include logic that may\nalter the flow of the application. In the example provided, the intent is to force the result of\nthe SQL query to always return a true. It is quoted the way it is to escape the existing query\nalready in place in the application.

Per the study material, if the port is open, you won’t get a\nresponse; however, if it’s in a closed state, you’ll receive a RST packet.\nA is incorrect because an Inverse TCP Flag scan is one in which TCP probe flags are\nsent with or without flags. No response indicates an open port, whereas a RST is sent\non a closed one. Flags typically used in this scan include FIN, URG, and PSH. As an\naside, if no flags are used, this can also be referred to as a null scan.\nC is incorrect because an XMAS scan is one where all TCP flags (FIN, URG, PSH)\nare turned on.

The\nzombie system will then craft a RST packet in answer to the unsolicited SYN/ACK,\nand the IPID will increase. If this occurs randomly, then it’s probable your zombie is\nnot in fact idle, and your results are moot.

The best advice I can give you is to memorize the really important\nones—the ones you know beyond a shadow of a doubt you’ll see on the exam\nsomewhere—and then use the process of elimination to get to the right answer.\nFor example, suppose you had no idea that TCP port 631 was used by the Internet\nPrinting Protocol (IPP), but you did know what 53, 88, and 445 were for. Suddenly\nit’s not that difficult (now down to a 50/50 chance). By the way, 631 won’t be the\nonly thing you’ll be monitoring for, but of the answers provided, it is the best choice.\nA is incorrect because 53 is the port number used by DNS (TCP and UDP). The TCP\nside will be used for across-Internet traffic, where the loss of speed due to connection-\noriented traffic is worth it to ensure delivery, and UDP will be mostly internal.\nB is incorrect because 88 is the port number used by Kerberos.\nC is incorrect because 445 is used for Microsoft SMB file sharing. You’ll definitely see\nSMB file sharing and this port somewhere on the exam, usually as part of a scenario\nlike the one in this question.\nD is incorrect because 514 is the (UDP) port number used by syslog—and trust me,\nyou need to know this one.

DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPOFFER, DHCPREQUEST,\nand DHCPACK are known as Solicit, Advertise, Request (or Confirm/Renew), and\nReply, respectively.\nA is incorrect because blocking all UDP 67 and 68 traffic would render the entire\nDHCP system moot because no one could pull an address.\nD is incorrect because DHCP filtering is done on the server and not the switch.\nDHCP filtering involves configuring the whitelist on the server itself."

Per Nmap’s support pages\n(https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-methods.html), this script “finds out what\noptions are supported by an HTTP server by sending an OPTIONS request and lists\npotentially risky methods. It tests those methods not mentioned in the OPTIONS\nheaders individually and sees if they are implemented. Any output other than\n501/405 suggests that the method is not in the range 400 to 600. If the response\nfalls under that range then it is compared to the response from a randomly generated\nmethod. In this script, ‘potentially risky’ methods are anything except GET, HEAD,\nPOST, and OPTIONS. If the script reports potentially risky methods, they may not\nall be security risks, but you should check to make sure.” You can also use additional\nparameters, such as url-path, to further hone your results.

The HTTP options themselves will show\nup somewhere, so knowing the difference, for example, between HTTP POST\n(submits data to be processed and is normally allowable) and HTTP PUT (allows a\nclient to upload new files on the web server, which normally shouldn’t be allowed)\nwill become very important to your success. According to OWASP, the following\noptions are important to know:\n• PUT This method allows a client to upload new files on the web server. An\nattacker can exploit it by uploading malicious files (for example, an .asp file that\nexecutes commands by invoking cmd.exe) or by simply using the victim’s server\nas a file repository.\n• DELETE This method allows a client to delete a file on the web server. An\nattacker can exploit it as a very simple and direct way to deface a website or to\nmount a DoS attack.\nCEH Certified Ethical Hacker Practice Exams\n• CONNECT This method could allow a client to use the web server as a proxy.\n• TRACE This method simply echoes back to the client whatever string has\nbeen sent to the server, and it’s used mainly for debugging purposes. This method,\noriginally assumed harmless, can be used to mount an attack known as\ncross-site tracing.\nB, C, and D are incorrect because these are not considered “risky” options."

The client then has to reconnect—and will do so quickly.\nThe idea behind this kind of activity is to generate lots of traffic to capture in order\nto discern the WEP access code (from clients trying to reassociate to all the new ARP\npackets that will come flying around, since many machines will dump their ARP\ncache after being shut off the network). Remember that the initialization vectors\nwithin WEP are relatively short (24 bits) and are reused frequently, so any attempt to\ncrack the code requires, in general, around 15,000 or so packets. You can certainly\ngather these over time, but generating traffic can accomplish it much faster. One\nfinal note on this must be brought up: this type of attack can just as easily result in a\ndenial-of-service attack against hosts and the AP in question, so be careful.\nA is incorrect because the response to a deauth packet does not contain the WEP\naccess code in the clear. If it did, the attacker wouldn’t need to bother with all this\ntraffic generation in the first place—one simple packet would be enough to crack all\nsecurity.\nC is incorrect because the basic service set identifier (BSSID) is the MAC address\nof the AP. It’s usually easy enough to gain from any number of methods (using\nairodump, for instance) and isn’t a reason for sending multiple deauth packets. There\nare networks where the BSSID is hidden (referred to as cloaking), but other tools\n(airmon and airodump) can help with that.\nD is incorrect because even if an SSID is “cloaked,” that doesn’t mean it’s actually\nhidden; all it means is that it is not broadcast. The SSID is still contained in every\nsingle packet sent from the AP, and discovering it is easy enough."

Whereas 802.11b clients could\nbe spread across a relative large distance, 802.11a clients could communicate much\nfaster but had to be closer together.

Not as many people use it, or\neven look for it, and its smaller range may work to assist you in preventing spillage\noutside your building.

There\nare, occasionally, some slipups (Internet search some of these; they’re truly funny),\nbut those are definitely the exception and not the rule.\nSpoofed links can be found by hovering a mouse over them (or by looking at their\nproperties). The link text may read www.yourbank.com, but the hyperlink properties\nwill be sending you to some IP address you don’t want to go to.\nAnd finally, any e-mail coming from an “unverified source” can and should be viewed\nwith caution. What makes something an unverified source? That depends on the eye\nof the beholder. In many cases, it’s simply an address (or person) you don’t know or\nhaven’t seen before. In others it’s a very close representation of an e-mail address you’d\nrecognize, but turns out to be malicious.\nIn any of these cases, your best bet for personal and organizational security is this:\nDon’t Click It.

In the government/DoD world, you’d see labels such as Confidential,\nSecret, and Top Secret. In the commercial world, you might see Public, Sensitive, and\nConfidential.

Levels of categorization vary from organization to\norganization, but usually assign response time frames to levels.\n• Notification Alerting appropriate teams and organizations to assist in the event\noccurs here.\n• Containment\nSteps to contain the incident occur here. These may include\nsteps to revoke or suspend user accounts and blocking system or even subnet\naccess via a firewall or other method.\n• Forensic investigation In this stage, if possible, live memory and disk captures\nare pulled for evaluation and analysis. This does not have to wait until the\nconclusion of the event, but, depending on the assets involved and the nature of\nthe incident, forensics may have to wait.\n• Eradication and recovery This phase encompasses all the steps taken to remove\nthe incident cause (malware, malicious code, backdoors, rootkits, viruses, and so\non) and to return the assets involved to baseline standards before putting them\nback into production.\n• Post-incident This is where reporting, follow-up analysis, and lessons learned\nare put together. Evaluation from this step is fed into the preparation phase for\nthe next event.\nQuestions on incident response and incident handling can be pretty vague.

Securing dumpsters\nand practicing good physical security should help protect against an insider who wants\nto come back after hours and snoop around. And performing background checks\non employees, although by no means a silver bullet in this situation, can certainly\nCEH Certified Ethical Hacker Practice Exams\nhelp to ensure you’re hiring the right people in the first place (in many companies a\nbackground check is a requirement of law).

If an attacker on Machine A wanted to receive a copy of this message, which of the following circumstances would be necessary?\nA. The ARP cache of the router would need to be poisoned, changing the entry for Machine A to 00-01-02-CC-DD-EE.\nB. The ARP cache of Machine B would need to be poisoned, changing the entry for the default gateway to 00-01-02-AA-BB-C\nC. C. The ARP cache of Machine C would need to be poisoned, changing the entry for the default gateway to 00-01-02-AA-BB-CC.\nD. The ARP cache of Machine A would need to be poisoned, changing the entry for Machine C to 00-01-02-BB-CC-DD.",
        "response": "B. ARP poisoning is done on the machine creating the frame—the sender. Changing the default gateway entry on the sending machine results in all frames intended for an IP out of the subnet being delivered to the attacker. Changing the ARP cache on the other machine or the router is pointless."

No, the hash shows a 14-character password; however, it is not complex.\nC. No, the hash reveals a 7-character-or-less password has been used.\nD. It is impossible to determine simply by looking at the hash.",
        "response": "C. LM hashes pad a password with blank spaces to reach 14 characters, split it into two 7-character sections, and then hash both separately. Because the LM hash of seven blank characters is always AAD3B435B51404EE, you can tell from the hash that the user has used only seven or fewer characters in the password. Because CEH recommends that a password be a minimum of eight characters, be complex, and expire after 30 days, the user is not following good policy."
