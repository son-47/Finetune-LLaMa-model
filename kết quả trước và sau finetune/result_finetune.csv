A. This is a bit of a tricky one, and one that you will see on the exam. In the question, you’re asked to
specify the flag that you will use to satisfy the condition that the attacker must scan every port on the server
several times. In this case, the -A flag is used for performing a SYN scan, which is the most common type of
attack used in the social engineering arena. The -A flag is not used for scanning every port on the server.
A and B are incorrect because the -g flag is used to specify the number of packets to send, and the -f flag is used
to specify the number of packets to receive. The -D flag is used to specify the number of threads to use.

deliver the malware, he used the current employees' email IDs to send fraudulent emails embedded with
malicious links that seem to be legitimate. When a victim employee clicks on the link, they are directed to a
fraudulent website that automatically loads Flash and triggers the exploit. What is the technique used byjack to
launch the fileless malware on the target systems?
A.  In-memory exploits
B.  Phishing
C.  Legitimate applications
D.  Script-based injection
","B. Script-based injection is the technique used by Jack to launch the fileless malware on the target systems. Script-based
injection is when a program is injected into the target system using a program that runs in the background and is
controlled by a script. The script is used to launch the exploit. The script is executed by the operating system and
does not need to be installed on the target system. The script is not embedded with a malicious link. Script-based
injection is not used in fileless malware attacks.
A is incorrect because an in-memory exploit is used in fileless malware attacks. An in-memory exploit is a program that
injects code into the target system and runs it without the need for a bootable media. The program is injected into
memory, and the system is rebooted, allowing the exploit to run.

","This is a bit of a tough one. The XXE vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability that occurs when a user
provides an input string to a web application that is expecting it to be a valid XML file. The system then
uses that input string to create a shell command that is executed on the server. It’s a bit of a catch-22, because the
system needs to be able to accept XML, but the user is expected to provide a valid XML file. This is a bit
of a difficult one because there are so many potential answers. The best way to think about it is to remember that
XML is a markup language, and markup languages are used to add structure to a document. This is a bit like
using HTML to describe a document. The system needs to be able to parse the XML and understand the structure.
If the system is expecting XML, and the user provides an input string that is not valid XML, the system will

A.  Detecting honeypots running on VMware
B.  Detecting the presence of Honeyd honeypots
C.  Detecting the presence of Snort_inline honeypots
D.  Detecting the presence of Sebek-based honeypots
","# A. In order to detect honeypots, Dayn uses a time-based TCP fingerprinting method to validate the response
to a normal computer and the response of a honeypot to a manual SYN request. The time-based TCP fingerprinting
method is a method that sends a SYN packet to a honeypot and then waits for a response. If a response is
received, the time of the response is compared against a database of responses to determine whether the response
is a honeypot response. If the response is not a honeypot response, the response time is compared against a
database of responses to determine whether the response is normal. If the response is a honeypot response, the
time of the response is compared against a database of honeypot responses to determine whether the response is
honey. In other words, Dayn is using the time of the response to determine if the response is a honeypot response.
